Our eyes are radio receivers
Units:
- Wavelength: $\lambda$ $[m]$
- frequency: $f$  $[Hz]$
-  Speed of wave: $\mu = f \lambda$

## Polarisation
The direction/orientation of the electrical part of a radio wave. If an antenna is aligned with the orientation of the wave, it will be able to receive the signal better. 
## Spectra
- VLF(Very Low Frequency): 3-30 kHz: Submarine comms
- LF (Low): 30-300 kHz
- MF (Medium): 300 kHz - 3 MHz
- HF (High Frequency): 3-30 MHz
- VHF (Very): 30-300 MHz
- UHF (Ultra): 300 MHz - 3 GHz: WIFI(2.4) GSM
- SHF(Super): 3-30 GHz: WIFI(5)
- EHF(Extreme): 30-300 GHz: Satellite comms
The higher the frequency, the more information can be modulated on to the signal, as there are more wavelengths per second.
Also higher frequency = Shorter antenna (shorter wavelength)
Optimal antenna length is half the wavelength (theoretically)
Drones sometimes use:
35 MHz
433 MHz
868 MHz
2.4 GHz
5 GHz
6 GHz

## Circular antennas
You can get around the directionality issue of radio waves by making the antennas circular and spinning the signal around, be mindful of spin direction, though.

## Power of radio waves
$$Voltage \ [dB] = 20\log_{10}\left( \frac{U_{1}}{U_{2}} \right)$$
$$Current \ [dB] = 20\log_{10}\left( \frac{I_{1}}{I_{2}} \right)$$
$$Power \ [dB] = 20\log_{10}\left( \frac{P_{1}}{P_{2}} \right)$$
The radio signal will force electrons to run through the antenna, changing direction with the radio wave amplitude. 
An antenna of half wave length allows the electrons to run freely.
Since waves travel slower in metal, metal antennas can be slightly shorter
Radio waves follow the square law. At double the distance it will have $\frac{1}{4}$ the power.
Directors can be used to direct the signal.
