Transmitted power of antenna:
$$P_{t} + P_{f} - P_{r}$$
$p_{f}$: Power forward
$P_{r}$: Power reverse
Return power in a coax cable creates a standing wave. Measuring the voltage max and min of the standing wave can tell you how much power is transmitted through the antenna
$$V_{max} = V_{f} + V_{r}$$
$$V_{min} = V_{f} - V_{r}$$
$$VSWR = \frac{V_{max}}{V_{min}}$$
Power law:
$$P=U\cdot I=\frac{U^2}{R}$$
$$SWR= \frac{1 + \sqrt{ \frac{P_{r}}{P_{f}} }}{1-\sqrt{ \frac{P_{r}}{P_{f}} }}$$
**If SWR is over 3, the transmitting should be stopped, it might break the transmitter. Anything over 2 should be improved.**
