- Modular
- Interoperable
- scaleable
- Maintainable

## Examples
Page 9 in L2_RobotArchitectures

## Deliberative 
### Think (hard), then act
Page 11-13 in L2_RobotArchitectures

## Reactive
### Don't think, just (re)act
Page 14-16 in L2_RobotArchitectures

## Hybrid
### Think and act concurrently (and separately)
Page 17-18 in L2_RobotArchitectures

## Behaviour-Based
### Think the way you act
