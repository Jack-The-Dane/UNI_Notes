Differential equations are equations that depend on one or more differentiations of a function.

## Ordinary differential equation
**Derivatives with respect to only one variable**
$${d²y\over dt²} + \omega²y = 0$$

## Partial differential equation
**Derivatives with respect to more than one variable**
$${\partial²u\over \partial t²} = c²{\partial²u\over \partial x^2} $$

## General types of PDEs
### 1. Linear PDE
$${\partial²u\over \partial t²} = c²{\partial²u\over \partial x^2} $$
Heat equation in 1D
It is linear because the original function u and derivatives are not multiplied by anything in the equation.

### 2. Nonlinear PDE

### 6. Coefficient type

If there is a multiplication of the independent variable in the equation, it is a variable type.

## Solutions and conditions
One PDE can have many different solutions. The initial and boundary condition are used to find a specific solution to an equation. 
The number of conditions required to solve the equation for a specifc solution depends on the order of the PDE.
Initial conditions define the value of the function to a certain time (t).
Boundary conditions define the value of the function to a certain spatial position (x).
### Dirichlet type

x will always equal 0
### Neumann type

## Wave equation (1D) - Udledning
$${\partial² u \over \partial t^2} = c^2 {\partial^2u \over \partial x²}$$
String under tension $T(x,t)$ , where
t = Time
c = Speed of wave
x = Horizontal position along string
$u(x,t)$ = velocity displacement
$\theta$ = Angle relative to horizontal
Assume external force $F(x,t)$ acting in the vertical position
