Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. The MST is a subset of the edges that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles, and with the minimum possible total edge weight. 
## How Prim's Algorithm Works 
1. **Initialization**: - Start with an arbitrary node as the MST, marking it as "included" in the MST. - The key concept is to always add the shortest possible edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside it. 
2. **Process**: - At each step, select the edge with the smallest weight that connects a vertex inside the MST to a vertex outside it. - Add the selected edge to the MST and mark the newly added vertex as part of the MST. 
3. **Repeat**: - Continue adding edges in this way until all vertices are included in the MST. 
4. **Termination**: - The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been added to the MST. The set of selected edges forms the minimum spanning tree. 
5. ## Steps in Detail 
6. **Initialize**: - Select any node as the starting node for the MST and set its weight to 0 (it is included in the MST). - Set the key value of all other nodes to infinity (`∞`), representing the minimum weight edge connecting them to the MST. 
7. **Use a Priority Queue**: - Maintain a priority queue (min-heap) to always extract the vertex with the smallest edge weight from the MST. 
8. **Algorithm Execution**: - While the priority queue is not empty: - Extract the node with the smallest key (edge weight). - Mark it as part of the MST. - For each of its adjacent vertices, if the weight of the edge is smaller than the current key value of the adjacent vertex, update its key and add it to the priority queue. 
9. **Final Step**: - When all vertices are included in the MST, the algorithm terminates.

## Time Complexity 
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(E \log V) \), where `E` is the number of edges and `V` is the number of vertices. The complexity comes from the priority queue operations, specifically the insertion and extraction of vertices.
- ## Use Cases 
- **Network Design**: Used to design least-cost networks, like connecting cities with roads or designing communication networks.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Applied in data clustering problems where it helps to form minimal connections between data points. 
- **Civil Engineering**: Can be used for designing road or electrical networks efficiently. 
- ## Key Differences from Kruskal’s Algorithm 
- **Prim’s Algorithm** builds the MST by adding edges one at a time starting from an arbitrary node, ensuring that the smallest edge weight connects nodes within the growing MST. 
- **Kruskal’s Algorithm** sorts all edges first and adds them to the MST as long as they do not form a cycle.
