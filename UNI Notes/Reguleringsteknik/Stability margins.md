The gain margin is the factor by which the gain can be rained before a system becomes
unstable.
Recall that a system is neutrally stable for:
$$\vert L(j \omega)\vert = 1 \text{  and  } \angle L(j\omega) = 180 \degree$$
where $L(s) = K(s)G(s)$
The phase margin is the amount by which the phase can be rained before a system
becomes unstable (before it exceeds -180â—¦).
A system is neutrally stable for:
$$\vert L(j \omega)\vert = 1 \text{  and  } \angle L(j\omega) = 180 \degree$$where $L(s) = K(s)G(s)$

If the gain line had been above the 0 dB line, the margin would be negative, and the system would be unstable.

## Good margins
It is good to have a phase margin of about $45 \degree$ and a gain margin of 3-6 dB.
