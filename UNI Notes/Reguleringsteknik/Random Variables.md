The solution is a Kalman filter that relies on a stochastic model, and noisy
measurements.
To introduce uncertainty and noise in the considered system models, we introduce
random variables.
Let X be a random variable describing the outcome of rolling a fair dice. The fair dice is
characterized by
- It has 6 different outcomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
-  The probability of getting each of the six outcomes is the same, i.e., $Pr(X = 4) = \frac{1}{6}$ .
-  The outcome of each roll of the dice is independent.
To describe the above dice mathematically, a probability mass function pX is associated
to X that determines the probability that X equals x, i.e.,:
