## Steady-state value of time function
If $Y(s)$ is unstable (poles in the right half-plane), $y(t)$ will be unbounded and not converge towards a result.
if $Y(s)$ has a pole pair on the imaginary axis, $y(t)$ wil be undefined when time goes to infinity. 
if $Y(s)$ is stable with poles in the left half-plane, and perhaps one at (0,0), $y(t)$ will converge towards a constant value.
