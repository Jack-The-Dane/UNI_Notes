There are three different performance measures for dynamical systems:
1. The rise time $t_r$
2. The settling time $t_s$
3. The overshoot $M_p$

The peak time is denoted $t_p$

## Rise time

Rise time can then be adjusted by $\omega_n$ 
## Settling time

Log is the natural logarithm.
## Peak time

## Overshoot

## Frequency and Time specifications

This is only valid for second order systems
