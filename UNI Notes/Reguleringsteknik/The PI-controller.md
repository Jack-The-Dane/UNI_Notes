The I in PID stands for integral, and this term is proportional to the integral of the error between the reference and the output.

## Motivation (Elimination of steady state error in P-controller)
The integral term will eliminate a steady state error in the P-controller, even if the system parameters are not perfectly known, unlike the feedforward method, which only works with perfectly known systems without niose.
